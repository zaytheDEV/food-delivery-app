Thank you for taking the time to view my food delivery app. This was the second app that I developed using React Native. As a front-end developer, the main purpose for this project was to demonstrate my ability for styling mobile apps with Tailwind. Also working with data structures as in arrays and objects. With this app I was also able to work with and connect APIs to provide the map features.

<b>Features</b>
<li>Restaurant Filtering</li>
<li>Quantity adjustment</li>
<li>View the driverâ€™s route</li>
<li>Zoom in and out of the map</li>
